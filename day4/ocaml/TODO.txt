* I think I could write a function that is a more generalized 
  version of what the "merge_non_empty_lines" function does.
  It could be namned something like "filter_fold_map" considering
  what the meaning of those words (filter, fold and map) has in
  Ocaml's Stdlib and Jane street's Base/Core library.

  Here is a half-ass or short start to implementing such function:

  List.filter_map

  let filter_fold_map f l =
      let rec loop accum_l l =
          match l with
          | [] -> accum_l
          | h::t -> 
              (match f h with
               | None -> loop accum_l t
               | Some x -> loop (h :: accum_l) t)
      in
      loop 

  let fold_func a b = 

  in
  List.fold_left fold_func a 

  String.cat
